I am a researcher working in the field of visual perception and attention, currently holding a lecturer position at the School of Psychology at Keele University in the UK. 

Before moving to the UK, I held postdoc positions at KU Leuven and UGent in Belgium and at EPFL in Switzerland. I did my studies at the University of Haifa in Israel, and taught at several HEI in Israel for a long time. At Keele I am teaching modules on cognitive and biological psychology as well as quantitative research methods.

Among my roles at Keele, I am the postgraduate research director and representative of the NWSSDTP scheme at the School of Psychology, as well as the research group lead for the cognition, brain and behavior stream.
