I am a researcher working in the field of visual perception and attention.
I did my studies at the University of Haifa in Israel. Since graduating, I have held postdoc positions at KU Leuven and UGent in Belgium and at EPFL in Switzerland. I have 10 years of teaching experience at different higher education institutions in Israel. My favorite subject to teach is Research Methods and Statistics. 


Research interests:
- perceptual grouping
- figure-ground organization
- prioritization of attention control signals
- programming in RStudio
- data science
- Bayesian statistics
