abstract: We examined the effect of combined top-down and bottom-up attentional control sources in easy and difficult visual search tasks. Applying a new analysis on previously acquired data, we focused on the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) and the response-locked posterior contralateral negativity (RLpcN), to better understand processes following target selection. We used the signed-area approach to measure the negative area, where the signal was either locked to the target or the response onsets. We further split the RLpcN into an early and a late segment to capture the dynamics of selection and post-selection processes. In Experiment 1, participants reported the orientation of a uniquely tilted target. In Experiment 2, participants reported the position of a small gap within the uniquely tilted target. In both experiments, endogenous cues manipulated top-down attention (valid vs. neutral), and salient color singletons (either the target or a distractor) manipulated bottom-up attention. We hypothesized that the SPCN and the later segment of the RLpcN would be modulated by task difficulty and target salience, as they are associated with post-selection processes, such as response selection and working memory. The early segment of the RLpcN was hypothesized to be modulated by the cueing manipulation and presence of a salient distractor, as they affect target selection. An effect of distractor presence was observed on the early segment of the RLpcN, and our results further supported the hypotheses regarding the SPCN and the later segment of the RLpcN, providing novel insights into post-selection processes in visual search.
