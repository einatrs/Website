abstract: Previous studies on the role of attention in percep- tual grouping have yielded contradicting findings, some sug- gesting that grouping requires attention and others indicating that it does not. Kimchi and Razpurker-Apfeld (Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 11(4), 687–696, 2004) showed that at- tentional demands in grouping could vary according to the processes involved. The current study expanded on this, ex- amining whether attentional demands vary for (a) different grouping principles and (b) as a function of contingent pro- cessing of element segregation and shape formation. We used the inattention paradigm with an online measure, in which participants engaged in an attentionally demanding change- detection task on a small matrix presented on a task- irrelevant backdrop of grouped elements. The backdrop grouping changed or stayed the same independently of any change in the target. Congruency effects produced by changes in backdrop grouping on target-change judgments indicate that the backdrop grouping was accomplished under inatten- tion. The results showed congruency effects when grouping formed columns/rows by proximity but not by shape similar- ity, and when grouping into a distinct shape by collinearity did not involve element segregation. No congruency effects were found when grouping into a shape by collinearity or connect- edness involved element segregation, except when connected- ness was combined with color similarity. These results suggest that attentional demands depend on the combination of group- ing principles and the complexity of the processes involved in the organization. These findings provide further support for the view that perceptual organization is a multiplicity of pro- cesses that vary in attentional demands.
