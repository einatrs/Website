title: Perceptual organization makes sense of the world 
---

**Perceptual organization** is a collection of **cognitive processes** that lead individual pieces of **visual input** to form a **coherent percept**. 

OK, that's a lot to digest, so let's break it down:

*Visual input* - whatever is out there in the world that our eyes make note of, for example colors, lights, shades, locations, shapes, lines, corners...

*Coherent percept* - something that we perceive as a meaningful whole, for example, a red dot, vertical columns, a 3D cube, an arrow, a house...

*Cognitive processes* - processes that are theorized to occur in the brain that are responsible for creating our internal world. Some of them link us to our external environment, for example, understanding language or knowing whether to pull or push a door open. Others are mainly internal, like making plans or trying to calculate 6*9 in your head. 

*Perceptual organization* - processes that take colors, lines and locations, and use them to construct an internal representation house.
