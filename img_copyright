Copyright is an inherent legal right of the photographer and you don't *have* to state it

I always do anyway, using (c) 2022 and name. 

Preventing image scraping and copying is a different issue - I watermark the images either directly in LIghtroom (which is how photograhers do it), or in Photoshop/similar program - in which I overlay a copyright statement or logo in white then make it very transparent so it only just shows.
